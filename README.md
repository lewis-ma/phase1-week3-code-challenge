This README file describes the purpose and functionality of the Flariton Movie Theatre's website movie table creation code. In this extended version of the README, we will go into more detail about the various components of this code and how to use it effectively.

Purpose

The purpose of this code is to create a movie table for the Flariton Movie Theatre's website that fetches data from the server and populates the table with the movie data. This table has several columns that contain information about each movie, including the movie ID, title, poster image, runtime, showtime, available tickets, buy ticket button, and delete button. The buy ticket and delete buttons have been given event listeners that update the server and remove the corresponding row from the table when clicked.

Prerequisites

Before using this code, there are a few prerequisites that must be met. Firstly, you will need a server that contains data for the movie table. This server should have endpoints for fetching all movies, updating the available tickets count, and deleting a movie. Additionally, you will need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to implement this code into your website.

Usage

Using this code is relatively straightforward. The HTML file contains the table structure and references the stylesheet. The JavaScript file fetches movie data from the server and populates the table. The buy ticket and delete buttons are given event listeners that update the server and remove the corresponding row from the table when clicked. Here's a step-by-step guide to using this code:

    Download the code and unzip the files.
    Place the HTML and JavaScript files in your website's directory.
    Make sure that your website's directory is linked to the server that contains the movie data.
    Open the HTML file in your text editor of choice and modify the table structure to match the requirements of your website.
    Modify the JavaScript file to match the endpoints of your server.
    Save the changes and open the HTML file in your web browser to view the movie table.
